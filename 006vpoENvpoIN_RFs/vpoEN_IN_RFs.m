% Computing Spike-Triggered Averages and Spectrotemporal Stimulus
% Properties driving vpoEN and vpoIN responses
%
% Related to Cell manuscript "Male-Male Interactions Shape Mate Selection
% in Drosophila" by Tom Hindmarsh Sten, Rufei Li, Florian Hollunder, Shade

% 
% % Description:
% This MATLAB script computes spike-triggered averages (STAs) and
% spectrotemporal receptive fields for vpoEN and vpoIN responses to playback of
% acoustic recordings from MF pair or MMF triads. The script processes
% calcium imaging and auditory stimulus recordings to derive key metrics 
% such as inter-pulse intervals (IPIs), carrier frequency (CF) distributions, 
% and their relationship to neural activity. Key steps include: 
%   - Spectrogram Analysis: Perform Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on the 
%    auditory stimulus to compute power spectra and center-of-mass frequencies.
%   - IPI Computation: Calculate inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) using pulse peak 
%    detection within overlapping temporal bins.
%   - Spike-Triggered Averages: Identify calcium response peaks and compute 
%    STAs of IPIs and CFs within a defined time window around each response.
%   - Distribution Analysis: Visualize IPI and CF distributions associated with 
%    neural responses.
%   - Stimulus-Response Mapping: Correlate neural responses with IPI and CF bins 
%    to gain insight into the the multiplexed receptive fields
%   - Spectrotemporal Receptive Fields: Create spectrptermporal receptive
%     fields for vpoEN and vpoIN neurons (spectral only, no IPI considered)
%
% Visualization:
% - Temporal dynamics of IPI and CF around neural responses.
% - Distributions of response-associated IPIs and CFs.
% - Heatmaps visualizing responses based on CF/IPI combinations
% - Heatmaps visualizing spectrotemporal receptive fields.
%
% Input:
% - `vpoEN_IN_exStimResponse.mat`: Contains stimulus and response data from
%   7 animals. Contains 4 structs (vpoEN/IN responses for MF playback or MMF
%   playback). Each struct has four fields: the acoustic stimulus, calcium
%   imaging traces across 7 animals, and synchronized timestamps for both signals. 
%
% Output:
% - Plots of temporal response dynamics, histograms of IPI/CF distributions, 
%   and spectrotemporal receptive field heatmaps.
%
% Dependencies:
% - Signal Processing Toolbox for STFT and peak detection.
% - function: prctfilt.m (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn-MATLAB/blob/master/utilities/prctfilt.m)
%
% Note:
% - The script is modular, allowing for analysis of different datasets 
%   (e.g., vpoIN_MF, vpoIN_MMF). Adjust parameters and data loading as needed.
