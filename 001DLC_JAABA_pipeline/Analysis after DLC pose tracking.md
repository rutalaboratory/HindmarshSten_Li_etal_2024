- Step0: Train DLC models
  - Details of our case see STAR Methods section of the manuscript
  - Examples of tracking fidelity were shown in a video in the folder
- Step1: After pose tracking, go through videos with identity labeled and correct identity swaps
  - reasonable number of swaps in our experience: less than 1 per minute (60fps recording)
    - if too many identity swaps, double check parameter settings & DLC model
    - customized scripts were used to correct identity swaps in the manuscript
    - note: DLC now includes module for identity correction
  - double check if corret all M-F swaps based on abdomen lengths
    - With high-resolution videos + healthy flies, should be able to tell the male and female apart based on abdomen length. i.e. female abdomen longer than male.

        - MF assays can be done in a similar way
- Step2: parameter computation after pose-tracking
  - Step2-0: data organization (one assay/folder, all folders for assays to process under the same parent folder)
    - required file for each assay: .h5 file after identity swaps correction
  - Step2-1: convert pose positions to animal and inter-animal features
    - Input: .h5 files
    - Script:
      - prepareForJAABA_MMF.ipynb
        - MF assays can be done in a similar way
    - Output: .csv files for each individuals in the assay
  - Step2-2:  convert those features to JAABA input format
    - Input: .csv files for each individuals in the assay
    - Script:
      - DLCwrite_JAABA_MMF.m
        - MF assays can be done in a similar way
    - Output: trx.mat and perframe folder for JAABA project
- Step3: JAABA classification and quick plots after classification
  - JAABA setup and train JAABA classifiers

    - JAABA detect to get score files 
    - Organize useful information into a MATLAB structure file
